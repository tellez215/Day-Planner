# <em> Day-Planner

## <em> Description
This project is called "Day Planner" and it was built to have a schedule where anyone can add their to-do's for the day from 9am-5pm, a usual work day scheduler! Users can type and save their scehdule with a simple click on the blue save button and will be saved and shown again when or if they need to come back and change any inputs they may have put. As the day continues on , the past times and to-do's the user has saved will turn grey as the day progresses , will turn red for the current hour the user is in, and will turn green for the upcoming times on the schedule.
